# update_user_job_category
Using API to update job category field in user data
Why do we need to use Job category? We, as a member of fulfillment network, has to use Job category to properly identify the walk-in user category and apply related fulfillment unit rules. By this way, we can avoid the deficiency of User group which is inappropriately applied to walk-in user under the fulfillment network.

ALMA does provide a job named “Update/Notify Users” to update user records in batch. However, this job merely provides job description modification capability, not job category modification choice.
